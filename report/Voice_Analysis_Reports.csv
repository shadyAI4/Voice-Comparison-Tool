SHADRACK,"This project deals with comparing voice recordings, one being the voice recording from the
crime scene and the voice recording from the potential suspect, using Mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCCs) techniques to extract features such as sample rate, Bit rate, frequency
bound, frames shift, frame length and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and generate a report that
help law enforcements to analyse and confirm the speaker in recordings","This project deals with comparing voice recordings, one being the voice recording from the
